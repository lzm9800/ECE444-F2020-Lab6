## Test cases I wrote for my group (group 7-Codesign)
https://github.com/ECE444-2020Fall/project1-webapp-group7-codesign/blob/develop/devour/recipes/tests.py#L102-L154

The tests I wrote is for checking the Django REST Framework's (DRF) filtering functionality. Ingredients are 
autocompleted using an API based on the DRF's filtering.

## What are the pros and cons of TDD?
Pros: TDD ensures that the developer has tested every functionality by having the developer first write the test, 
then write the function to pass the test. This means that every new functionality should have a test associated to it.
By maintaining this habit, the program will certainly have less bug and thus higher quality and security. It is also a
good habit for developer to have by having the developer consider each possible cases first about their functionality.

Cons: TDD can have a slower development than other types of development process. This is because TDD require the test
to be written before the function. The developer will need to first think about the tests necessary for it first
before able to write the actual function. Comparing to writing function first then test, some functions may be trivial,
but TDD will require the test cases regardless. In a sprint, TDD may be difficult to keep up especially when a
deadline is approaching. It might be better to deliver a working code, then test extensively.
